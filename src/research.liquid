<h2> My Research </h2>

<p>Here I will attempt to explain my research over the course of (possibly many) posts.</p>


<p>
    Here's the short version first: <br><br>
    Cluster algebras are algebras that exhibit a particular struture that is in 
    some sense very combinatorial. People care about these for various reasons. 
    A Grassmannian is a collection of subspaces of some space that all have the 
    same dimension. Such a collection forms a 'variety' which makes geometers happy.
    People also care about these for various (typically diferent) reasons.
</p>
<p>
    If you happen to live in the intersection of these two groups of people, then
    boy are you in luck. It turns out that the algebra of functions on a Grassmannian
    enjoys a cluster structure. My research revolves around trying to understand this structure through the means of categorification. Specifically, a particular category constructed by Jensen, King and Su.

    <li> Cluster Algebras</li>
    <li> Grassmannians</li>
    <li> Cluster structure on the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian</li>
    <li> Quiver Representations</li>
    <li> Categorification</li>
    <li> The category CMC</li>
</ul>
