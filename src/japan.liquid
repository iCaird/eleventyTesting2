<h2> Japan School & Conference Blog</h2>

<p> From the 18th-30th November I will be at the OIST in Okinawa, Japan for the 
    school and conference:  </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin: 0"><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/autumn-oist-school-conference/home"
    >New developments in representation theory of algebras: <br>
        Algebraic, combinatorial and geometric aspects</a></h3>

<p> I'll be attempting to blog the trip, talking about both the maths I learn
    and the experience of being in Japan for the first time. Posts I make should
    populate a list below. I'll try add a filter at some point to the list so 
    you can choose between posts about maths and posts about Okinawa if you so
    desire.
</p>
{%  assign posts = collections.japan | reverse %}
{% for post in posts %}
    <p>
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a>  <b>{{ post.date | date: "%d-%m-%y" }}</b>
    </p>
