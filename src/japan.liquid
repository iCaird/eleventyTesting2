<h2> Japan School & Conference Blog</h2>

<p> From the 18th-30th November I will be at the OIST in Okinawa, Japan for the 
    school and conference:  </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin: 0"><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/autumn-oist-school-conference/home"
    >New developments in representation theory of algebras: <br>
        Algebraic, combinatorial and geometric aspects</a></h3>

<p> I'll be attempting to blog the trip, talking about both the maths I learn
    and the experience of being in Japan for the first time. Posts I make should
    populate a list below. <s>I'll try add a filter at some point to the list so 
    you can choose between posts about maths and posts about Okinawa if you so
    desire. </s> </p><p> Okay I've implemented a rudimentary whitelist in that if a post has atleast one of the selected tags then it will appear. I spent way too long doing it so please use it once.</p>
<div id="japan-tag-filters">
        {% for tag in filterTags %}
                <label class="japan-filter-label">
                        <input type="checkbox" class="japan-filter-checkboxes" value="{{ tag }}" checked=true>
                        {{ tag }} 
                </label>
	{% endfor %}


</div>
{%  assign posts = collections.japan | reverse %}
{% for post in posts %}
        <div class="japan-post-container" data-tags={{ post.data.tags | join: "," }}>
